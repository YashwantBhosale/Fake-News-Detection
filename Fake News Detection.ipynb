The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

from a senate committee on tuesday as she tried to win lawmakers over to president donald trumps proposal to slash her departments funding by 13 percent devos a republican who narrowly won senate approval for her post in february after strident opposition from democrats and a few fellow party members testified before the senate appropriations subcommittee on education about the proposed budget trump submitted to congress last month trumps plan to cut 9 billion from the education departments budget would improve educational opportunities and shift the federal role in education devos told the panel i understand those figures are alarming for many she said however this budget refocuses the department on supporting states and school districts in their efforts to provide highquality education to all our students democrats took turns asking devos about the bigger budget lineitems and talking about students who they say could be hurt by large spending cuts the most pointed exchanges were on whether private schools that receive federal funds would have to agree not to discriminate against students devos would only repeat that schools taking federal money must abide by us law but senator jeff merkley and his fellow democrats said she was refusing to answer the question because federal law is unclear in many areas of possible discrimination such as the rights of transgendered people lawmakers are expected to alter trumps proposed budget before voting on it  the subcommittees chair conservative republican roy blunt said he believed congress would not approve the budget as proposed such a significant cut to the departments budget is likely untenable blunt said pressing specifically to preserve funds for technical programs workstudy financial aid and the special olympics civil rights groups and democrats say the budget would send public dollars to private companies disband afterschool care hurt schools in poor neighborhoods shrink the ranks of teachers and make it harder for many to afford college  devos is currently working on major transformations in student loans the budget suggests changing incomebased repayment plans and ending loan forgiveness for workers in the public sector which devos said would clear up confusion around the loans with the stated aim of giving parents more choices for their childrens education devos and republicans support charter schools which are publicly funded but operate independently frequently by corporations as well as subsidies to help pay privateschool tuition many republicans on the panel applauded the budgets proposal to boost such school choice programs but the subcommittees senior democrat patty murray said the cuts highlight the ways that the policies and priorities you and president trump are pushing would hurt students hurt communities and represent a clear broken promise to workers and the middle class  \",\n          \"wisconsin governor scott walker has blown so much money on his vanity presidential campaign that he put himself 12 million dollars in debt an odd accomplishment for a  fiscally conservative  republican who says that our government s debt is the most evil thing everwalker is trying to sell off the surplus garbage campaign merchandise that nobody wanted to buy the first time around in order to cover his debts he sent out an email begging people to buy tshirts from him for 45 if you really want to wear a tshirt which will announce to everyone how stupid you are you can find similar walker merch online for about half the pricewalker isn t even able to fulfill color or size requests due to a  lack of resources  he wants you to pay 45 bucks for something you may not even want to or be physically able to wear properly don t worry though if you get a shirt that is 3 sizes too small or a hideous color he also said in the email that the shirts can be framed or used for  crafty things  like a pillow cover or bagthat  exactly what i d do lay my head on a scott walker pillow as i stare at a scott walker framed tshirt on my wallwalker dropped 90000 a day on his 70day presidential run which is a fact he isn t divulging to the people he s asking for cash 70 days is pretty impressive to go from the great white rightwing hope to  scott who in the email that he sent out to the people who are now upset that they forgot to unsubscribe from his mailing list months ago walker made some strange statements about how careful he is with money if there is one thing the american people learned about me during our presidential campaign it is that i am thrifty source apwalker then went on to cite how he uses coupons and loves hitting up the discount racks when shopping do they give coupons for failed presidential vanity campaigns intended for boosting speaking fees and book dealsthere s 1200000 worth of irony to be found in a  thrifty  guy who is against big spending asking people to waste 45 bucks on what is essentially an  i m with stupid  tshirt he would
